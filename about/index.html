        <p><strong>Jaz-Marie</strong> is a concatination of my first and middle names, Jazmine + Marie, and is what my mom
            often calls me. I was born in Oakland, raised in Yokohama, Japan, and currently live in the San Francisco/ Bay Area 
            California. I speak Spanish and my Japanese could use some work...
            <br><br>I have a Master's of Science degree in engineering from Santa Clara University <em>(Go Broncos!)</em> and
            currently work as an Applications Engineer. When I'm not coding Matrix style, I'm taking photos, doing yoga, 
            traveling the world, <a href="/lifestyle">various other things</a>, or learning something new. 
            <br><br>Which brings me to why this site is here: simply put, I wanted to learn web development and the best way 
            I can motivate myself is to work on a "real-world" project. I also needed a place to demonstrate/list 
            my newly aquired skills and keep track of what I'm working on. You can dig through my academic 
            history <a href="/education">here</a>.
            <br><br>You can also contact me <a href="/contact">here</a>.
