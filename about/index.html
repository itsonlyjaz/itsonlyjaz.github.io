    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <div> 
        <p><strong>Jaz-Marie</strong> is a concatination of my first and middle names, Jazmine + Marie, and is a place for me 
            to show who I am and what I do. I'm always learning -- this website was created out of a desire to learn web 
            development and a need to motivate myself to the end. What better way to motivate yourself other than to make it 
            real? So I sketched out what I wanted, regardless of how little I knew, and I got to work learning what I needed 
            to know in order to make it happen.</p>
            <br>
            <br><p>I studied C in school, use Java at work, and am interested in a few other languages like Scala and Python. 
            <strong>So the big question is <em>why?</em></strong> I work with power regulators and it's really interesting
            learning how they work and observing their behavior. But coding allows for much more flexibility and I love being 
            able to turn a concept in my head into something that I can present visually to others. HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
            are powerful little tools with many, many branches such as Node.js and AngularJS (both of which, I'm currently 
            learning!). The list of languages and scripts can go on and on and that, for me, is a big part of what draws me 
            to them: you will never get to a place where your learning is complete.</p>
            <br><br><p>Needless to say, this site is by no means perfect or complete. It is, and will be (for now), a work in 
            progress. And because life is about more than just code, I wanted to also show a glimpse into who I am when I 
            step away from the computer screen. I love writing code, and I also love photography, yoga, traveling, and 
            various other things.</p>
