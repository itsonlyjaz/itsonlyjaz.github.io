    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <div> 
        <p><strong>Jaz-Marie</strong> is a concatination of my first and middle names, Jazmine + Marie, and is a place for me 
            to show who I am and what I do. This website was created out of a desire to learn web 
            development and a need to motivate myself to the end. What better way to motivate yourself other than to make it 
            real? So I sketched out what I wanted, regardless of how little I knew, and I got to work learning what I needed 
            to know in order to make it happen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I studied C in school, use Java at work, and am interested in a few other languages like Scala and Python. 
            <strong>So the big question is <em>why?</em></strong> I work with power regulators and it's really interesting
            learning how they work and observing their behavior. But coding allows for much more flexibility and I love being 
            able to turn a concept in my head into something that I can present visually to others. HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
            are powerful little tools with many, many branches such as Node.js and AngularJS (both of which, I'm currently 
            learning!). The list of languages and scripts can go on and on and that, for me, is a big part of what draws me 
            to them: there's always something new to discover and/or build upon. Coding definitely keeps me interested!</p>
            <br>
            <p>...I also like the reaction I get whenever someone looks at my screen and has no idea what I'm doing
            when I'm coding in a public place (like Starbucks). I mean, <em>don't we all??</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>But on a serious note, I've always been a "language enthusiast". I grew up speaking Japanese and decided to learn
            Spanish (I currently live in California). I figured since I was so keen to learn how to speak to humans from 
            different places, why not learn how to speak to machines from different platforms? Programming language <em>is</em> a
            language, afterall.</p> 
            <br>  
            <p>Of course, learning a language is completely by trial and error. Needless to say, this site is by no means perfect or complete. It is, and will be (for now), a work in 
            progress. And because life is about more than just code, I wanted to also show a glimpse into who I am when I 
            step away from the computer screen. I love writing code, and I also love photography, yoga, traveling, and 
            various other things.</p>
