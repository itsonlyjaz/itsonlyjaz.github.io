        <p><strong>Jaz-Marie</strong> is a concatination of my first and middle names, Jazmine + Marie, and is a place for me 
            to show who I am and what I do. I'm always learning; this website was created out of a desire to learn web 
            development and a need to motivate myself to the end. What better way to motivate yourself other than to make it 
            real? So I sketched out what I wanted, regardless of how little I knew, and I got to work learning what I needed 
            to know in order to make it happen. 
            <br>
            <br>This site is by no means perfect or complete. It is, and will be (for now), a work in progress. And because 
            life is about more than just code, I wanted to also show a glimpse into who I am when I step away from the 
            computer screen. I love writing code, and I also love photography, yoga, traveling, and <a href="/lifestyle">
            various other things</a>. 
            <br><br>So please have a look around! To skip to my work and academic history, you can <a href="/career">click here</a>.
